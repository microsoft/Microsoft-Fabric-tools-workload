## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Base Control Implementation

- **Editor Foundation**: All item editors should now inherit from the standardized Base Editor component
- **View Patterns**: Consistent Detail View and Empty View patterns for all workload items  
- **Ribbon System**: Complete ribbon implementation with standardized action patterns
- **Layout Components**: Proper responsive layouts with Fabric design system integration

### SCSS Architecture Best Practices

- **Editor-Specific Stylesheets**: Each item editor should have its own `.scss` file for editor-specific styling
- **Global Fabric Styles**: Keep global stylesheets clean with only Fabric platform styles and design tokens
- **Clear Separation**: Avoid mixing editor-specific customizations with global Fabric styling patterns
- **Modular Organization**: Editor styles in dedicated files (e.g., `HelloWorldItemEditor.scss`) 
- **Maintenance Benefits**: Easier to update global Fabric styles without breaking editor-specific customizations

### Development Workflow

- **Best Practice Guidance**: Updated AI context to include proper component architecture patterns
- **Code Generation**: AI assistants now generate code using new standardized components automatically
- **Migration Assistance**: Enhanced AI instructions for helping migrate existing components to base components

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Script Issues

#### Bug #17: DevGateway Script Execution Issues

- **Issue**: PowerShell script execution failed with parameter passing errors
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect boolean parameter handling in cross-platform environments
- **Fix**: Updated `start-devGateway.js` to use proper PowerShell parameter syntax
- **Impact**: DevGateway now starts correctly on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### Bug #13: Memory Management Issues

- **Issue**: Memory leaks or inefficient memory usage causing performance degradation
- **Root Cause**: Memory allocation problems in component lifecycle or data handling
- **Fix**: Implemented proper memory management and cleanup procedures
- **Impact**: Improved application performance and stability, reduced memory footprint

#### Build Script File Locking Issues

- **Issue**: Manifest package builds failed when `build\Manifest\temp` folder was locked by other processes or terminals
- **Root Cause**: Multiple processes (setup, DevGateway) tried to delete/modify the same shared temporary folder
- **Fix**: Build process now uses unique system temporary folders (`%TEMP%\Fabric_Manifest_Build_GUID`) for each build
- **Impact**: Eliminates file locking conflicts, allows parallel builds, automatic cleanup after build completion

#### Script Fixes for Deployment and Release

- **Issue**: Syntax errors and typos in `BuildRelease.ps1` and `BuildManifestPackage.ps1` scripts
- **Root Cause**: Missing quotes in string literals, incorrect variable names (`realease` vs `release`)
- **Fix**: Corrected PowerShell syntax errors and standardized variable naming
- **Impact**: Release packaging and Azure deployment scripts now execute without errors

### Additional Fixes

- Fixed stylesheet compilation issues in development environment
- Resolved component rendering inconsistencies with Fluent UI v9 migration
- Fixed responsive design breakpoints for better mobile experience
- Corrected deployment script parameter validation

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### Manifest Item Folder Structure

- **Folder Naming Convention**: All item folders in `Workload/Manifest/items/` must now follow the pattern `[ItemName]Item` (e.g., `HelloWorldItem`, `ExcelTableEditorItem`)
- **Previous Pattern**: Items were previously stored as `[ItemName]` without the `Item` suffix
- **Migration Required**: Rename existing manifest item folders to include the `Item` suffix
- **Impact**: CreateNewItem script now creates folders following this standardized pattern

### Build Process Changes

- **Selective Item Packaging**: Only items declared in the `ITEM_NAMES` variable in `.env` files are included in the NuGet package build
- **Previous Behavior**: All items in the Manifest/items folder were automatically included
- **Required Action**: Ensure all desired items are listed in `ITEM_NAMES` in `.env.dev`, `.env.test`, and `.env.prod`
- **Example**: `ITEM_NAMES=HelloWorld,ExcelTableEditor`
- **Impact**: Provides better control over which items are deployed in each environment

### Stylesheet Changes

- Global stylesheet structure reorganized
- Component-specific styles moved to dedicated modules
- CSS class names standardized for consistency

## 📖 Documentation Updates

### Enhanced Guides

- Updated component usage documentation with Fluent UI v9 examples
- Added stylesheet architecture documentation
- Enhanced troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Improved setup and configuration instructions

### New Documentation

- **Base Components Usage Guide**: Comprehensive guide for using new standardized components
- **Editor Implementation Guide**: How to build editors using Base Editor component  
- **Ribbon Integration Guide**: Step-by-step ribbon implementation patterns
- **Detail View Patterns**: Best practices for consistent detail views
- **Empty State Guidelines**: Implementing proper empty states with onboarding
- **JSDoc Reference System**: Added comprehensive documentation links to all main control components for quick navigation from code to docs
- **Documentation Reorganization**: Moved HelloWorldItem documentation under `/docs/items/` for better organization
- CSS organization and theming documentation
- Data playground user guide
