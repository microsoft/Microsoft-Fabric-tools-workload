### Enhanced Stylesheet Architecture
- Split stylesheets into modular, maintainable components
- Defined default Fabric-specific styles and design tokens
- Improved CSS organization for better maintainability
- Added consistent theming support across all components

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Base Control Implementation
- **Editor Foundation**: All item editors should now inherit from the standardized Base Editor component
- **View Patterns**: Consistent Detail View and Empty View patterns for all workload items  
- **Ribbon System**: Complete ribbon implementation with standardized action patterns
- **Layout Components**: Proper responsive layouts with Fabric design system integration
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation built into all base controls

### UI Component Standardization
- Migrated all components to use Fluent UI v9 consistently
- Standardized button, input, and layout components
- Improved responsive design patterns
- Enhanced accessibility compliance across all controls

### Stylesheet Improvements
- Separated global styles from component-specific styles
- Created reusable CSS modules for common patterns
- Optimized stylesheet loading and performance
- Added CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### SCSS Architecture Best Practices
- **Editor-Specific Stylesheets**: Each item editor should have its own `.scss` file for editor-specific styling
- **Global Fabric Styles**: Keep global stylesheets clean with only Fabric platform styles and design tokens
- **Clear Separation**: Avoid mixing editor-specific customizations with global Fabric styling patterns
- **Modular Organization**: Editor styles in dedicated files (e.g., `HelloWorldItemEditor.scss`) while keeping `styles.scss` for global patterns
- **Maintenance Benefits**: Easier to update global Fabric styles without breaking editor-specific customizations

### Development Workflow
- Enhanced build processes for better component management
- Improved development server configuration
- Better integration between frontend and backend components
- Streamlined deployment preparation

### AI Development Assistant Enhancements
- **Updated AI Instructions**: Enhanced GitHub Copilot instructions to recommend base controls by default
- **Base Control Patterns**: AI now suggests using standardized components (Base Editor, Detail View, etc.)
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Updated AI context to include proper component architecture patterns
- **Code Generation**: AI assistants now generate code using new standardized controls automatically
- **Migration Assistance**: Enhanced AI instructions for helping migrate existing components to base controls

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Script Issues

#### Bug #17: DevGateway Script Execution Issues
- **Issue**: PowerShell script execution failed with parameter passing errors
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect boolean parameter handling in cross-platform environments
- **Fix**: Updated `start-devGateway.js` to use proper PowerShell parameter syntax
- **Impact**: DevGateway now starts correctly on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### Bug #13: Memory Management Issues
- **Issue**: Memory leaks or inefficient memory usage causing performance degradation
- **Root Cause**: Memory allocation problems in component lifecycle or data handling
- **Fix**: Implemented proper memory management and cleanup procedures
- **Impact**: Improved application performance and stability, reduced memory footprint

### Additional Fixes
- Fixed stylesheet compilation issues in development environment
- Resolved component rendering inconsistencies with Fluent UI v9 migration
